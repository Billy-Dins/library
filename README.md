## Odin Project
This project was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)
The intent of this project was to further practice DOM manipulation. Emphasis was placed on array manipulation and object constructors.

## Challenges
I previously had practice with array manipulation in prior JS challenges however I came across a problem once I had set up the framework for my webpage where I had the structure to create book elements with the correct object elements displayed however had no way to delete the object. This was because I was creating the object as an HTML element within the DOM as opposed to an array object. Understanding how to render an array onto a web page and calling that function made all other implementations much easier after that point
